# odin-recipes

This is Food Recipe website and it is static.
I used different html elements, tags and attributes to
make this website.
'h1' is used for main headings, 'h3' for each topic heading
and 'h5' for subtopic heading.
'img' element is used for adding images
'a' element is used for links
Relative links are the type of links used in this project.
I used unordered (ul) and ordered lists (ol) for listing the 
Incredients and Steps for the making of Recipe.
