# odin-recipes

This is Food Recipe website and it is static.
I used different html elements, tags and attributes to
make this website.
<h1> is used for main headings, <h3> for each topic heading
and <h5> for subtopic heading.
<img> is used for adding images
<a> is used for links
Relative links are the type of links used in this project.
I used unordered and ordered lists for listing the 
Incredients and Steps for the making of Recipe.
